Steps to Enable PowerShell Scripts Execution on Windows 10
To enable PowerShell scripts, follow the steps:

1. Press the Windows Key to open the Start menu.
2. Type “PowerShell“.
3. Right-click on the PowerShell result and select “Run as administrator“.
4. After opening the PowerShell window, execute “get-executionpolicy” to know the current execution policy.
5. Chances are it will say “Restricted“. This means the scripts are blocked.
6. In the PowerShell window, execute the “set-executionpolicy remotesigned” command.
7. Type “A” next to the confirmation message and press “Enter“.

You’ve changed the execution policy to enable PowerShell scripts.
That is all. From now on you can execute the scripts created directly on your machine or signed scripts download from the internet or other computers.

If you want to run unsigned scripts downloaded from the internet or other computers, you need to set the execution policy to “unrestricted”. To do that, execute the “set-executionpolicy unrestricted” command in the PowerShell window.

To disable the PowerShell script execution, run the “set-executionpolicy restricted” command and you are good to go.
